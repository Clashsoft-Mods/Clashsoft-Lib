Clashsoft's Minecraft Library
=======
Clashsoft's Minecraft Library (Clashsoft Lib) is a library for Minecraft that combines many classes used in everyday modding life. It also provides several APIs. For example, the Clashsoft Library has a Cape API that allows modders to display capes on the backs of players. It also has a full dimension API, supporting Chunk Provider, Custom Biomes, Teleporters and Custom Portal Blocks. This reduces redundant code in other mod projects a lot and makes modding for Minecraft easier.
